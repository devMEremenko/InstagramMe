# Hi there!

This is a simple viewer of the Instagram feed.

The project was created back in Spring 2016 to use new approaches, and of course just for fun.
It is no longer supported since then, except for iOS 11 and Xcode 9 optimization.

If you want to launch it, you have to register your own app on [Instagram Developer Platform](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) and include `InstagramAppClientId` to the `Info.plist` due to the Instagram Developer Platform requirements.
